FileHandler is a generic C++ library written specifically for Niotso and used to read, and sometimes modify and write,
the various types of files used in The Sims Online.

FileHandler outsources most of its work to de-facto third-party libraries written in C89 (zlib, libpng, libjpeg-turbo,
libmpg123, ...), while other libraries, also written in C89, are provided inside FileHandler, without a flashy name (bmp, cst,
iff, far, ...).

FileHandler wraps around these libraries and provides a convenient C++ API to interact with these files to just the degree
needed by Niotso. The function of FileHandler is analogous to the gimex library used in The Sims Online.

Supported formats:
  Image:
    (*) bmp, png, jpg, cur, tga
  Audio:
    (*) wav, mp3, xa, utk
  Archive:
    (*) far, iff
  Plain-text:
    (*) ini, xml, cst, uis
