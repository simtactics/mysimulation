libvitaboy is a cross-platform C++ library for parsing the various character rendering formats used in The Sims Online and using
that information to render and animate the 3D characters of the game using OpenGL.

Formats include:
  (*) ANIM (Animation)
  (*) APR  (Appearance)
  (*) BND  (Binding)
  (*) COL  (Collection)
  (*) HAG  (Hand Group)
  (*) MESH (Mesh)
  (*) OFT  (Outfit)
  (*) PO   (Purchasable Outfit)
  (*) SKEL (Skeleton)


1.  What this library will do for you

You can use this library to render a character in a predetermined location.


2.  Compiling

Compiling is straightforward. The Makefiles and project files should already be set up for you, and are easy to tweak.
Before compiling the library, make your changes to config.h to specify what's compiled in.

  a. Compiling from a Makefile

    Makefiles are listed in the top directory in the format Makefile.$(PLATFORM). Just copy the one applicable to your platform
    to the destination file "Makefile" and run GNU make.

  b. Compiling from a project file

    Project files are held within their own directories. They can be opened up with the target IDE and be compiled by
    invoking the compile action of that IDE.

  c. Compiling using your own Makefile or project file

    It's possible no such file exists for your platform. In this case, look at whichever Makefile is most relevant to your
    platform, copy all source files down (.cpp, .hpp, ...), and add it your own Makefile or project. In theory,
    it should work. :)

libvitaboy is intended to work with any C++ compiler. If not, and the compiler is not only modern and popular but also free
software (gratis, libre, open source software), please report it as a bug.
