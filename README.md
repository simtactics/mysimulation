My Simulation is an **experimental** open source multiplayer game based upon The Sims Online. It attempts to mimic the original game as closely as possible while extending it with new features.

The client is written in Zig and uses Raylib game engine with NioTSO's libraries for interacting with The Sims' proprietary formats. FreeSO's API server is used for the backend.
